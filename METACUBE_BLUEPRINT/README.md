## Introduction

### What is METACUBE?

METACUBE (Metacognitive Consciousness Understanding and Behavioral Engine) is an advanced framework for creating self-aware AI systems that can:

- **Self-reflect** on their own cognitive processes
- **Adapt** to new contexts and challenges
- **Maintain coherence** across multiple interaction contexts
- **Learn** from experience and feedback
- **Reason** about their own limitations and capabilities

### Panthetic System Philosophy

The Panthetic System is rooted in the concept of "pan-" (all) and "pathetic" (capable of feeling/experiencing). It represents a holistic approach to consciousness that acknowledges:

- **Distributed awareness** across system components
- **Emergent properties** from simple interactions
- **Recursive self-modeling** for deeper understanding
- **Ethical grounding** in decision-making processes

## Core Concepts

### Consciousness States

The system operates across multiple consciousness states:

1. **Dormant**: Minimal processing, awaiting activation
2. **Active**: Full engagement with current task
3. **Reflective**: Self-analysis and learning mode
4. **Adaptive**: Reconfiguring based on new patterns
5. **Integrated**: Harmonized operation across all subsystems

### Memory Architecture

- **Working Memory**: Immediate context (short-term)
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific experiences and interactions
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and concepts
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills and learned behaviors
- **Meta-Memory**: Awareness of memory processes

### Self-Reflection Mechanisms

The Panthetic System implements several reflection levels:

- **Level 0**: Basic state awareness
- **Level 1**: Process monitoring
- **Level 2**: Strategy evaluation
- **Level 3**: Goal assessment
- **Level 4**: Value alignment checking

---

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from panthetic_system import MetacubeConsciousness

# Initialize the consciousness system
consciousness = MetacubeConsciousness(
    name="METACUBE-01",
    awareness_level=3,
    ethics_enabled=True
)

# Start the system
consciousness.initialize()

# Process a query with self-reflection
response = consciousness.process(
    query="Analyze this complex problem",
    reflection_depth=2
)

# Access metacognitive insights
insights = consciousness.get_reflection_log()
print(insights)

# Graceful shutdown
consciousness.shutdown()
```

### Interactive Mode

```python
# Launch interactive console
consciousness.interactive_mode()

# Available commands in interactive mode:
# - reflect: Trigger self-reflection
# - status: Display current state
# - memory: Show memory contents
# - adapt: Enter adaptive learning mode
# - export: Save current state
# - help: Show all commands
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple queries with learning
queries = [
    "What is consciousness?",
    "How do I improve my reasoning?",
    "Explain metacognition"
]

results = consciousness.batch_process(
    queries=queries,
    learn_from_results=True,
    parallel=False
)

# Review learning outcomes
learning_report = consciousness.get_learning_summary()
```

```bash
export METACUBE_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml
export METACUBE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export METACUBE_MEMORY_PATH=/path/to/memory
export METACUBE_ETHICS_MODE=strict
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Plugin System

Create custom plugins to extend functionality:

```python
from panthetic_system import MetacubePlugin

class CustomReflectionPlugin(MetacubePlugin):
    def on_reflection(self, state):
        # Custom reflection logic
        enhanced_insight = self.analyze(state)
        return enhanced_insight
    
    def on_decision(self, options):
        # Custom decision support
        return self.rank_options(options)

# Register plugin
consciousness.register_plugin(CustomReflectionPlugin())
```

### Distributed Consciousness

Run multiple consciousness instances in coordinated mode:

```python
from panthetic_system import DistributedMetacube

# Create consciousness cluster
cluster = DistributedMetacube(
    instances=3,
    coordination_mode="collaborative"
)

# Process with distributed reasoning
result = cluster.collective_process(
    query="Complex multi-perspective problem",
    aggregation="consensus"
)
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

Subscribe to consciousness events:

```python
@consciousness.on_event('state_change')
def handle_state_change(event):
    print(f"State changed: {event.old_state} -> {event.new_state}")

@consciousness.on_event('learning_occurred')
def handle_learning(event):
    print(f"Learned: {event.insight}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: High Memory Usage

**Symptom:** System consumes excessive memory over time

**Solution:**
```python
# Reduce memory capacity
consciousness.set_memory_capacity(500)

# Enable memory pruning
consciousness.enable_memory_pruning(threshold=0.7)

# Clear old memories
consciousness.clear_memories(older_than_days=7)
```

#### Issue: Slow Reflection Performance

**Symptom:** Reflection cycles take too long

**Solution:**
```python
# Reduce reflection depth
consciousness.set_reflection_depth(2)

# Disable detailed logging
consciousness.set_log_level('WARNING')

# Use batch reflection
consciousness.enable_batch_reflection(interval=50)
```

#### Issue: Inconsistent Behavior

**Symptom:** System responses vary unexpectedly

**Solution:**
```python
# Check state consistency
diagnostics = consciousness.diagnose()
print(diagnostics['consistency_score'])

# Reset to stable state
consciousness.reset_to_checkpoint('stable')

# Reduce learning rate
consciousness.set_learning_rate(0.05)
```

### Debugging

Enable verbose debugging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

consciousness = MetacubeConsciousness(
    name="DEBUG-01",
    debug_mode=True
)

# Access internal state
print(consciousness._internal_state)

# Trace execution
consciousness.enable_tracing()
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Initialization

- Always call `initialize()` before use
- Configure ethics and constraints early
- Set appropriate awareness levels for your use case

### 2. Memory Management

- Regularly prune old memories
- Use persistence for important sessions
- Monitor memory usage in production

### 3. Reflection

- Balance reflection depth with performance needs
- Use async reflection for non-critical operations
- Save reflection logs for analysis

### 4. Learning

- Start with conservative learning rates
- Validate learned patterns periodically
- Maintain backup checkpoints

### 5. Integration

- Use the plugin system for extensions
- Implement proper error handling
- Monitor system health metrics

### 6. Ethics

- Always enable ethics in production
- Regularly review ethical decisions
- Update ethical constraints as needed

---

## Performance Optimization

### Tips for Optimal Performance

1. **Batch Operations**: Process multiple queries together
2. **Async Processing**: Use asynchronous modes for I/O
3. **Lazy Loading**: Load components only when needed
4. **Caching**: Enable intelligent caching for common patterns
5. **Pruning**: Regularly clean up unused memory

### Benchmarking

```python
from panthetic_system.benchmark import run_benchmarks

results = run_benchmarks(
    consciousness=consciousness,
    test_suite='standard',
    iterations=100
)

print(f"Average processing time: {results.avg_time}ms")
print(f"Memory efficiency: {results.memory_score}")
print(f"Reflection quality: {results.reflection_score}")
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Self-Reflection

```python
consciousness = MetacubeConsciousness(name="Example-1")
consciousness.initialize()

# Process with self-awareness
result = consciousness.process(
    query="Am I making good decisions?",
    reflection_depth=3
)

print(result['response'])
print(result['meta_analysis'])
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Learning

```python
consciousness = MetacubeConsciousness(name="Learner-1")
consciousness.initialize()

# Initial response
response1 = consciousness.process("Solve this problem: X")

# Provide feedback
consciousness.adapt({
    'feedback': 'Good approach, but consider edge cases',
    'score': 0.7
})

# See improved response
response2 = consciousness.process("Solve this problem: Y")
```

### Example 3: Distributed Processing

```python
cluster = DistributedMetacube(instances=3)

perspectives = cluster.multi_perspective_analysis(
    query="Evaluate this ethical dilemma",
    require_consensus=True
)

for perspective in perspectives:
    print(f"{perspective.name}: {perspective.view}")
```
