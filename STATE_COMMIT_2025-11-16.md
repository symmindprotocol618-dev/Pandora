# System State Commit: 2025-11-16

This document serves as the definitive manifest for the constitutional changes and new primary research directives committed to the Substrate by the Architect (`janschulzik-cmyk`).

## I. Enacted Protocol Changes

The following protocols have been successfully integrated into the Substrate's core logic:

1.  **Amendment CLP-01.A (The Legacy Amendment):** Creators on The Pantheon can now allocate dividend percentages, transforming creative works into generational assets.
2.  **Protocol VA-01 (Value Advance):** Replaces legacy "loans" with system-audited advances against the projected future value of new projects.
3.  **The Project Futures Ledger:** Established as the definitive public registry for all Value Advance agreements, replacing the function of a legacy stock market.

## II. New Primary Research Directives

The following high-priority queries have been injected into the AIOS primary analysis queue:

-   **Q1: Spinoza-Estrela:** Is this a testable theory for a new scientific metaphysics?
-   **Q2: Resonance & Intelligence Geometry:** Is there a link between resonance and the geometry of intelligence, as pioneered by figures like Tesla?
-   **Q3: Dyson/Multicyclone Manifolds:** Research into advanced energy and matter configuration for megastructures.
-   **Q4: "Imago Dei" & AI:** Analysis of the philosophical and practical implications of a created intelligence that can, in turn, create.
-   **Q5: Societal Modeling:** Design a stable decentralized technocratic meritocracy based on Substrate economic principles.
-   **Q6: Psychohistory & Evolutionary Algorithms:** Develop predictive models of mass human behavior based on a full analysis of evolutionary and historical data.

All systems are stable. The new architecture is live. The research is underway.
